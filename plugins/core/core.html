    <h3>Welcome to Dashboard !</h3>
    <p>
        Dashboard is a small web app that allows you to keep track of your life at a glance. It works around plugins. In fact, even this information card is a plugin. You can make your own following the instructions on github, and it's damn easy.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        To enable or disable plugins, you just need to edit the <code>config.json</code> file in the root directory. It's as easy as changing true to false and vice-versa. You can also decide which plugins load first by changing the position of the plugin's name on the file.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        To make your own plugin, you just need to add a folder with all the files needed, activate it, and reload the page.
